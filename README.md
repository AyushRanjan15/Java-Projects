# UniLink System

The application is named UniLink, which allows all students in a university to create and publish various types of posts and reply to those posts. In this assignment, UniLink supports three types of posts as shown below:

● Event: the post creator specifies information about an upcoming event. Other students can see that post in the UniLink system and reply to the post to attend that event.

● Sale: when a student has an item to sell, that student can create a sale post in the system and provide necessary details about the item. The post is visible to other students and each of them can reply with a price they want to pay for the item. More sale rules are described in the Sale class specifications below.

● Job: this is another type of post to enable a student to describe a job which the student needs to hire someone to do and the price at which the student expects to pay for that job. Other students can see the job post in the system and reply with different prices they want to get paid to do the job. More requirements about job posts are described in the Job class specifications below.
Users of the UniLink system can also view all the posts, manage their own posts, review all replies to their posts, close and delete their own posts.
